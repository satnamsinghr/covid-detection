ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project implements a deep learning-based CNN model to detect COVID-19 infections from chest X-ray images.
By leveraging convolutional layers and careful preprocessing, the model distinguishes between COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases with high accuracy.

The work demonstrates the potential of AI in medical imaging, especially during pandemic situations where rapid diagnosis is crucial.

ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

COVID-19 caused a global crisis where fast and reliable diagnostic tools became essential.

Traditional RT-PCR tests were time-consuming and not always accessible.

X-ray imaging is widely available and cheaper, but manual interpretation is slow.

Using CNNs, we automate X-ray image analysis for faster and more accurate COVID detection.
